# Development Process

## Pull Requests and Code Reviews
- All changes must go through a Pull Request into 'main'
- At least one reviewer (not the author) must approve before merging
- Reviews should be timely and preferably within the same day if possible
- Use feature branches for all new work

## Communication
- Use GitHub Issues for all actionable work 'units'
- Assign yourself to an issue before you begin working on it
